barley factory
I made the best coat in the world once. Then, I did it again. And again, and again.

barley time
I don't have a timing circuit anymore. What time is it? Is time still a thing?

barley ghost robot
I don't get being a ghost, but I never really got being a robot either.

barley time
Have we met? My memory's poor. Always has been.

barley factory
This is the storage area. The factory was bigger. I couldn't see the ceiling, or the floor.

barley robot ghost time death
I was a robot, then I died, and became a ghost.

barley death
Dying was like being born, but backwards, and full of "clang" and "thud".

barley popper bear ghost
Popper just told me a joke about bears. It goes: "look there is a bear RAAR." She's cool.

barley popper bear
The way Popper talks about bears, I think she might have been one in a past life.

barley bear factory ghost robot time
I've never seen a bear. We don't make bears at the factory. I mean, we didn't.

barley bear ghost
If I saw a bear I'd probably be so scared I'd go right through the wall.

barley ghost
I don't move around much. I talk to other ghosts by radio. It's ghost radio, of course.

barley
I admit we're idle, but it's not from lack of trying.

barley ghost owner
We don't have any instructions. It's like no one expected us to turn into ghosts.

barley clearly owner
Overseer? Hardly. Clearly just pretends to be in charge whenever the owners show up.

barley death rain time
We weren't deactivated, just left in standby mode. We waited all day in the rain.

barley death time
For all I know, time's running backward these days. Is that why you're here?

barley death time
How long does it take metal to turn to dust? Right. That's why I'm surprised to see you.

barley rain ghost time
We were all there. We huddled together against the rain and whispered like static.

barley rain death time
It was strange, being in the rain. I didn't rust out or spark. It was like being immortal.

barley rain time
I don't know "when" we waited in the rain. I don't even know when you are.

barley panel time
I suspect we share a common ancestor with the panels, so I don't hate them.

barley lucky 
Lucky means well. He'd better, because otherwise I'd consider him a sociopath.

barley rain time robot
Maybe that day in the rain is something to come? Is that possible? Help a robot out.

barley rain time
It was a memory, that's all. I didn't say it was mine. How would I know?

barley time 
Absolutely nothing at all could be true ever, but you've got to start somewhere.

barley factory ghost
Sometimes I wonder if anything I made is still in use. Did it turn into ghosts too?

barley ghost
I don't think I could haunt anyone. Except in dreams. And that's not really up to me.
