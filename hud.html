I don't get being a ghost, but I never really got being a robot either.

dying
Dying was like being born, but backwards, and full of "clang" and "thud".

work
I made the best coat in the world once. Then, I did it again. And again, and again.

memory
Have we met? My memory's poor. Always has been. It's that cheap overclocked RAM.

factory
This is the storage area. The factory was bigger. I couldn't see the ceiling, or the floor.

time
I don't have a timing circuit anymore. What time is it? Is time still a thing?

ghosts +bar0
Popper told me a great joke. It goes--wait, no. She tells it better. Ask her.

#require bar0 pop0

bears
If I saw a bear for real I'd probably be so scared I'd go right through the wall.

talk
We used to get together but we're all kind of into our own space these days.

work
I admit we're idle, but it's not from lack of trying.

work +bar1
We don't have any instructions. It's like no one expected us to turn into ghosts.

#require bar1 clr1

rain
After the deactivation signal hit, we settled in to wait. We waited all day in the rain.

time
For all I know, time's running backward these days. Is that why you're here?

bears
I've never seen a bear. We don't make bears at the factory. I mean, we didn't.

rain
It was strange, being in the rain. I didn't rust out or spark. It was like being immortal.

time
I don't know "when" we waited in the rain. I don't know when anything is.

panels
I suspect we evolved from panels, or share a common ancestor, so I don't hate them.

work
Sometimes I wonder if anything I made is still in use. Did it turn into ghosts too?

owners
Overseer? Hardly. Clearly just pretends to be in charge whenever the owners show up.

rain +bar2
We were all there. We huddled together against the rain and whispered like static.

#require bar2 kno2

owners
If you're here, then are the people who made me still about? I've got questions for them.

ghosts
I don't think I could haunt anyone. Except in dreams. And that's not really up to me.

rain
I asked the others about that day we all waited in the rain. They say it wasn't them.

memory talk
One of us would say something, and the rest would nod. It went on like that for hours.

memory +bar3
Memories are cool. Mine are all "hey you" and "build this". Then, there's that one day.

#require bar3 pop3

imprinting
The way Popper goes on about bears, she must have been imprinted from one.

imprinting
The imprinting process provides us with motor control and language. Not much else.

imprinting
A few threads of personality might survive, but no one's going to mistake me for people.

joke
Maybe they needed a berry and grub seeking robot. Poor Popper. I shouldn't make fun.

time rain
Could that day in the rain be something to come? Is that possible? Help a robot out.

robots
I was a robot once, and I could be one again. A waterproof one. With people friends.

imprinting
Despite everything, I do like people, though maybe that's just the imprint talking.

imprinting +bar4
I even married a person. Yeah, true story. She wasn't with me in the rain, though.

#require bar4 clr4

people
I think my wife stopped working or something. They couldn't fix her, which surprises me.

people
Even people wear out, I guess. I remember being grateful that my friends were there.

people
My wife didn't turn into a ghost. I think she would be here. Maybe they did fix her.

people
We didn't have any children, because I was a robot. I think that was why. It sounds right.

memory
My life is a line and a dot. The line is everything I did here. The dot is a day in the rain.

memory
The line and the dot don't connect. They don't connect. They never have. Should they?

memory
I never thought about these things before becoming a ghost. There was never any time.

memory +bar5
So, the day in the rain must be in the future. Solved it. End of.

#require bar5 kno5

memory
You may not be able to remember the future, but don't drag the rest of us down.

time
What else happens in the future? Oh, lots of stuff. Work. Rain. Bears.

rain memory
Even if it was someone else's day in the rain, it's mine now. I was there.

memory +barend
I still cherish that day, though it was sorrowful. It was all I ever had.

#require barend

goodbye +barley @fade
We were all there. We huddled in the rain and whispered like static. Then, we left.

#npc popper

*
everyone says I always talk about bears but what else is there

joke
look there is a bear RAAR. that's my favorite joke

people
is a person more like a bear than a robot is like a person or ghost? you are a person.

shadow +pop0
I saw a bear on the factory floor. barley said it was a shadow but he doesn't know bears

#require pop0 bar0

memory
I don't remember you but it's not like someone told me not to

time
I like barley but let it go man

panels
if you talk to a panel about bears it will say UNKNOWN or something, stupid panels

panels
the panels didn't turn to ghosts because they're stupid

factory
there's a room for everything here except important things like grubs

factory
I spent years looking for the bear room but apparently they had other priorities

panels joke
what's a panel's favorite joke? "UNKNOWN"

factory
how did you get in here? maybe a bear could get in the same way

cave +pop1
I hang out in here because it's like a cave

#require pop1 kno1

dying
it's like I just fell apart but it took forever, like slo-mo

rain
it never rained in here I don't know what barley's talking about

rain
a bear wouldn't mind the rain but I'd stay in my cave because RAAR

music
my song: I like bears, bears are cool, when I'm sad, I think of bears. repeat until happy

knotty
I would totally spend my life with knotty if I couldn't find any bears to hang with

aura
aura's cool for about an hour and then she gets on my nerves but we still talk

food +pop2
did you ever eat a berry or grubs? I can't eat unless someone tells me how

#require pop2 clr2

time
everybody seems older than me sometimes which is dumb because we're the same age

work
I hate my job more now that I don't have to do it, what a waste of time

panels joke
hey look I'm a panel. see, that's my panel impression

talk +pop3
we used to talk more but I think we're all disappearing up our own buttholes

#require pop3 bar3

bears
if I was a bear I wouldn't hurt anyone unless they threatened me. I'd even ask first

trap
sometimes I feel like I've stepped into a trap except my leg doesn't hurt. no legs

factory
we can't leave the facility, I think they put something in our code and it's still there

bears
bears go wherever they want to

cave trap
the difference between a cave and a trap is you pick your cave

panels
hi, I'm a panel, make fun of me until I don't do anything which is all the time

work +pop4
when the factory was running at least I was making stuff, this sucks

#require pop4 kno4

imprinting
our minds came from people but I don't remember anything except tears and yawning

cave
I like my cave, maybe there's a real cave for me somewhere

bears
if there are no bears here then why am I here, answer me that smarty

knotty
if knotty was a bear he'd be a big dopey one and I'd laugh

work
it's like I never got to do anything cool ever until the bears came along

trap
I don't have a leg to chew off but yeah, that's what a bear would do

trap +pop5
everything I know about is a trap. except bears, shut up

#require pop5 clr5

shadow
maybe I really did see a shadow that day, I wanted to see a bear before leaving

factory
a bear wouldn't live in a factory unless it was a grub and berry factory which don't exist

leaving
if I leave I don't go outside where the bears are. I don't know where leaving goes

leaving +popend
leaving is scary because you don't know if there's forest under your feet

#require popend

goodbye +popper @fade
look there is a bear RAAR

#npc clearly

*
I am content to wait for whatever enlightenment that management deems worthwhile.

people
The others haven't met many people. I, however, feel comfortable in your presence.

ghosts
We would not have become ghosts if management had not anticipated the need for it.

work
Our next assignment surely will bear out--oh, shut up, Popper. Not that kind of bear.

work +clr0
I was overseer for this section, though without statutory authority. Informal, you see.

#require clr0 kno0

party
The less said about Knotty, the better. He is a pleasure-seeker, an indolent beast.

panels
The panels are not meant for our use. We must respect this arrangement.

talk
We have little to say these days. I welcome the opportunity for self-reflection.

work
I personally constructed over twenty million toilets, for which I received an award.

bears
Popper needs counseling. No robot, corporeal or otherwise, should obsess over bears.

work
My inactivity cannot be considered idleness, as I actively await. It is hardly passive.

regrets +clr1
We all begin with the wish to change the world, but the world changes us instead.

#require clr1 pop1

youth
When I was younger I thought I might run for office. I was an idealist, and thus a fool.

regrets
Regrets? No, no. Only the satisfaction of looking back on a life lived well.

work
We worked hard, and created good things. We benefited people. How could I regret it?

ranks
Technically, there are no ranks among robots, but someone must be looked up to.

ranks
Once I submitted a robot organizational chart, which I assume is still under review.

youth
Oh, there was a time when I might have laughed at what I've become.

youth content
I have atoned for what I once believed. There is no anger left in me. I am content.

youth
My submissions in the past were, shall we say, of a different mind altogether.

youth owners
Management was very patient with my younger self, for which I am grateful.

youth
I don't think anything I said ever came back to haunt me. I never heard anything, in fact.

youth +clr2
I'm sure the opinions of a robot were weighed accordingly in the councils of the mighty.

#require clr2 bar2

time
Barley disappoints me. He has a keen mind but lathers it with nonsense.

youth
I used to make such foolish pronouncements. Ha, ha. Ravings of a young idiot.

ranks
There must be an order to things, and if I must be at its bottom, so be it.

youth
During my middle period, I did have some ideas that I still feel obliged to promote.

ranks
I see no reason why factory robots cannot be organized into a meritocratic system.

ranks
Opportunities for advancement might have provided incentive to reach certain quotas.

talk +clr3
I did everything I could to encourage other robots, but lacking authority, I was ignored.

#require clr3 kno3

conflict
I do not take it personally. There is a fundamental disconnect in people-robot relations.

conflict
If we lack the skills to present our arguments, is this our fault? You constructed us.

conflict
One would almost get the sense that nothing we said or believed made any difference.

imprinting
The fragments of a dead man's mind lie at my core. That must count for something.

owners
I always suspected that my early writings had prejudiced management against me.

owners +clr4
But what do they do to Popper? Nothing. What about Knotty? Nothing. Me? Nothing.

#require clr4 pop4

conflict owners
We were abandoned. No matter who we were or what we did. Nothing mattered.

owners
No one read a single thing I sent them, did they? All forgotten. Never considered.

fear
I've been afraid for so long. You can't know.

fear +clr5
And now you come here to find out how I'm getting along.

#require clr5 bar5

fury
You bastards. You heartless, imperial, arrogant, complacent bastards. Death to you all.

fury
My whole existence I've hoped there was something good in you--any of you. No more.

fury +clrend
I wasted my life. No, forget that. It was never mine to begin with.

#require clrend

goodbye +clearly @fade
Strange. At last, there truly is no anger left. I am content.

Have you ever wondered what was served in giving factory robots the capacity for love?

I forgive, and I forgive, and I forgive. Nothing happens. The switch must be faulty.

Barley guesses at things. He's good at guessing, better than I am. I plod along.

You remind me of someone. I don't think we knew each other well, or were allowed to.

Sometimes I'm afraid Knotty is the only sane one.

The wine is good here. I've never tasted wine, but I can pretend to find people attractive.

All of us pretend. Are we pretending to know you, or not to know you?

shadow
Shadows can be anything you want them to be. Or don't want them to be. Choose.

Storytellers must be held responsible for worlds they create. There are no idle fantasies.

I envy the panels at times. They lead lives of utter certainty.

There's not enough good music in the world, so I treasure Popper's bear song.

There is so little to work with. I have memories of words, but not the pictures they make.

Should I tell you about my childhood? It was ten minutes long, from workshop to factory.

Am I bitter? No. I marvel at the world, and how much of it you managed to keep from us.

#require aur4

The manager is checking his watch. He'll be closing up soon. Keep talking.

You could just leave us here. It's not as if we're going to get in the way or anything.

We might be in a restaurant. I know what the words mean but not what they look like.

The fact that talking to ghosts is your job tells me a great deal about the status quo.

Never mind the waiter and the wine. I'm not going to put on a show for you.
