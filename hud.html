time work factory
I made the best coat in the world once. Then, I did it again. And again, and again.

time memory
Have we met? My memory's poor. Always has been. It's that cheap overclocked RAM.

time factory
This is the storage area. The factory was bigger. I couldn't see the ceiling, or the floor.

time memory
I don't have a timing circuit anymore. What time is it? Is time still a thing?

ghosts robots
I don't get being a ghost, but I never really got being a robot either.

time dying
Dying was like being born, but backwards, and full of "clang" and "thud".

#message popper-joke Listen to Popper's joke.
!bears ghosts time $popper-joke
Hey, have you heard Popper's joke yet?

?bears @barley-1
Yeah! That's a good one.


#section barley-1

bears ghosts
If I saw a bear for real I'd probably be so scared I'd go right through the wall.

ghosts talk
I don't move around much. I talk to other ghosts by radio. It's ghost radio, of course.

work
I admit we're idle, but it's not from lack of trying.

work ghost
We don't have any instructions. It's like no one expected us to turn into ghosts.

time dying rain @barley-2
After the deactivation signal hit, we settled in to wait. We waited all day in the rain.


#section barley-2

time
For all I know, time's running backward these days. Is that why you're here?

bears factory
I've never seen a bear. We don't make bears at the factory. I mean, we didn't.

rain
It was strange, being in the rain. I didn't rust out or spark. It was like being immortal.

rain
We were all there. We huddled together against the rain and whispered like static.

rain time
I don't know "when" we waited in the rain. I don't know when anything is.

panels
I suspect we evolved from panels, or share a common ancestor, so I don't hate them.

work time ghosts
Sometimes I wonder if anything I made is still in use. Did it turn into ghosts too?

#message clearly-ideas Talk to Clearly.
!owners work $clearly-ideas
Clearly has some interesting ideas about why we're here. Yeah. Interesting.

?owners @barley-3
Overseer? Hardly. Clearly just pretends to be in charge whenever the owners show up.




#section barley-3

owners time
If you're here, then are the people who made me still about? I've got questions for them.

ghosts owners
I don't think I could haunt anyone. Except in dreams. And that's not really up to me.

time memory talk
I asked the others about that day we all waited in the rain. They say it wasn't them.

time memory talk
One of us would say something, and the rest would nod. It went on like that for hours.

memory owners time
Memories are cool. Mine are all "hey you" and "build this". Then, there's that one day.

bears imprinting @barley-4
The way Popper goes on about bears, she must have been imprinted from one.



#section barley-4

imprinting
The imprinting process provides us with motor control and language. Not much else.

imprinting
A few threads of personality might survive, but no one's going to mistake me for people.

bears owners robots joke
Maybe they needed a berry and grub seeking robot. Poor Popper. I shouldn't make fun.

time memory
Could that day in the rain be something to come? Is that possible? Help a robot out.

robots time
I was a robot once, and I could be one again. A waterproof one. With people friends.

imprinting owners
Despite everything, I do like people, though maybe that's just the imprint talking.

#message aura-stuff Talk to Aura.
!love memory $popper-joke
Aura might be able to fill you in on that.

?love @barley-5
I even married a person. Yeah, true story. She wasn't with me in the rain, though.



#section barley-5

memory owners
I think my wife stopped working or something. They couldn't fix her, which surprises me.

time love
Even people wear out, I guess. I remember being grateful that my friends were there.

owners time
My wife didn't turn into a ghost. I think she would be here. Maybe they did fix her.

robots love
We didn't have any children, because I was a robot. I think that was why. It sounds right.

time rain memory
My life is a line and a dot. The line is everything I did here. The dot is a day in the rain.

memory
The line and the dot don't connect. They don't connect. They never have. Should they?

memory
I never thought about these things before becoming a ghost. There was never any time.

memory @barley-6
So, the day in the rain must be in the future. Solved it. End of.



#section barley-6

memory
You may not be able to remember the future, but don't drag the rest of us down.

time
What else happens in the future? Oh, lots of stuff. Work. Rain. Bears.

rain memory
Even if it was someone else's day in the rain, it's mine now. I was there.

memory goodbye
I still cherish that day, though it was sorrowful. It was all I ever had.

goodbye barley -goodbye @barley-end
We were all there. We huddled in the rain and whispered like static. Then, we left.
