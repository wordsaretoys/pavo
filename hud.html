@npc barley @hello factory
I made the best coat in the world once. Then, I did it again. And again, and again.

@hello time
I don't have a timing circuit anymore. What time is it? Is time still a thing?

@hello ghost robot
I don't get being a ghost, but I never really got being a robot either.

@hello time
Have we met? My memory's poor. Always has been.

factory
This is the storage area. The factory was bigger. I couldn't see the ceiling, or the floor.

robot ghost time death
I was a robot, then I died, and became a ghost.

@bump death time
Dying was like being born, but backwards, and full of "clang" and "thud".

@section @hello popper bear ghost
Popper just told me a joke about bears. It goes: "look there is a bear RAAR." She's cool.

popper bear
The way Popper talks about bears, I think she might have been one in a past life.

bear factory ghost robot time
I've never seen a bear. We don't make bears at the factory. I mean, we didn't.

bear ghost
If I saw a bear I'd probably be so scared I'd go right through the wall.

ghost
I don't move around much. I talk to other ghosts by radio. It's ghost radio, of course.

@bump barley
I admit we're idle, but it's not from lack of trying.

ghost owner
We don't have any instructions. It's like no one expected us to turn into ghosts.

clearly owner
Overseer? Hardly. Clearly just pretends to be in charge whenever the owners show up.

@section death rain time
We weren't deactivated, just left in standby mode. We waited all day in the rain.

death time
For all I know, time's running backward these days. Is that why you're here?

death time
How long does it take metal to turn to dust? Right. That's why I'm surprised to see you.

rain ghost time
We were all there. We huddled together against the rain and whispered like static.

rain death time
It was strange, being in the rain. I didn't rust out or spark. It was like being immortal.

@bump rain time
I don't know "when" we waited in the rain. I don't even know when you are.

panel time
I suspect we share a common ancestor with the panels, so I don't hate them.

lucky 
Lucky means well. He'd better, because otherwise I'd consider him a sociopath.

@section rain time robot
Maybe that day in the rain is something to come? Is that possible? Help a robot out.

rain time
It was a memory, that's all. I didn't say it was mine. How would I know?

time 
Absolutely nothing at all could be true ever, but you've got to start somewhere.

@bump factory ghost
Sometimes I wonder if anything I made is still in use. Did it turn into ghosts too?

@end ghost
I don't think I could haunt anyone. Except in dreams. And that's not really up to me.
