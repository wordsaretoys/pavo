ghosts robots
I don't get being a ghost, but I never really got being a robot either.

time ghosts
Dying was like being born, but backwards, and full of "clang" and "thud".

time work factory
I made the best coat in the world once. Then, I did it again. And again, and again.

time memory
Have we met? My memory's poor. Always has been. It's that cheap overclocked RAM.

time factory
This is the storage area. The factory was bigger. I couldn't see the ceiling, or the floor.

time memory
I don't have a timing circuit anymore. What time is it? Is time still a thing?

#message pj Find Popper and listen to her joke. 
!popjoke ghosts $pj
Popper told me a great joke. It goes--wait, no. She tells it better. Ask her.

#message pjc Completed: Find Popper and listen to her joke. 
?popjoke joke +bar0 $pjc
Yeah, that's it. Popper got me twice with that one.

#require bar0

bears ghosts
If I saw a bear for real I'd probably be so scared I'd go right through the wall.

ghosts talk
We used to get together but we're all kind of into our own space these days.

work
I admit we're idle, but it's not from lack of trying.

work ghosts
We don't have any instructions. It's like no one expected us to turn into ghosts.

#require bar1

time dying rain
After the deactivation signal hit, we settled in to wait. We waited all day in the rain.

time
For all I know, time's running backward these days. Is that why you're here?

bears factory
I've never seen a bear. We don't make bears at the factory. I mean, we didn't.

rain
It was strange, being in the rain. I didn't rust out or spark. It was like being immortal.

rain
We were all there. We huddled together against the rain and whispered like static.

rain time
I don't know "when" we waited in the rain. I don't know when anything is.

panels
I suspect we evolved from panels, or share a common ancestor, so I don't hate them.

work time ghosts
Sometimes I wonder if anything I made is still in use. Did it turn into ghosts too?

owners
Overseer? Hardly. Clearly just pretends to be in charge whenever the owners show up.

#require bar2

owners time
If you're here, then are the people who made me still about? I've got questions for them.

ghosts owners
I don't think I could haunt anyone. Except in dreams. And that's not really up to me.

time memory talk
I asked the others about that day we all waited in the rain. They say it wasn't them.

time memory talk
One of us would say something, and the rest would nod. It went on like that for hours.

memory owners time
Memories are cool. Mine are all "hey you" and "build this". Then, there's that one day.

#require bar3

bears imprinting
The way Popper goes on about bears, she must have been imprinted from one.

imprinting
The imprinting process provides us with motor control and language. Not much else.

imprinting
A few threads of personality might survive, but no one's going to mistake me for people.

bears owners robots joke
Maybe they needed a berry and grub seeking robot. Poor Popper. I shouldn't make fun.

time memory
Could that day in the rain be something to come? Is that possible? Help a robot out.

robots time
I was a robot once, and I could be one again. A waterproof one. With people friends.

imprinting owners
Despite everything, I do like people, though maybe that's just the imprint talking.

love
I even married a person. Yeah, true story. She wasn't with me in the rain, though.

#require bar4

memory owners
I think my wife stopped working or something. They couldn't fix her, which surprises me.

time love
Even people wear out, I guess. I remember being grateful that my friends were there.

owners time
My wife didn't turn into a ghost. I think she would be here. Maybe they did fix her.

robots love
We didn't have any children, because I was a robot. I think that was why. It sounds right.

time rain memory
My life is a line and a dot. The line is everything I did here. The dot is a day in the rain.

memory
The line and the dot don't connect. They don't connect. They never have. Should they?

memory
I never thought about these things before becoming a ghost. There was never any time.

memory
So, the day in the rain must be in the future. Solved it. End of.

#require bar5

memory
You may not be able to remember the future, but don't drag the rest of us down.

time
What else happens in the future? Oh, lots of stuff. Work. Rain. Bears.

rain memory
Even if it was someone else's day in the rain, it's mine now. I was there.

memory
I still cherish that day, though it was sorrowful. It was all I ever had.

#require barend

@ goodbye +barley
We were all there. We huddled in the rain and whispered like static. Then, we left.
